Instructions for running the OddMon collector inside the Granite OpenShift cluster


Setup
=====

1) Need a Splunk forwarder pod
  A) Check out the docs at https://doc.granite.ccs.ornl.gov/integration-nccs/splunkExport/
  B) Need two persistent volume claims: one for the log files and one for the forwarder to store state information
  C) Use the splunkforwarder*.yaml files
  D) The configmap.yaml file has dummy passwords in it.  
    1) Actual passwords can be retrieved from the pkpass util (if your username is xmr).
    2) We don't want the passwords in the git repo, so don't add the passwords to the yaml file
    3) Upload the yaml file as-is and then edit it from the OpenShift GUI.
2) RabbitMQ server pod
  A) Doesn't seem to be a pre-packaged version available, so use a docker build
  B) Need a persistent volume we can write to.
    1) Mostly for a backing store for queued messages, but Erlang (which is what RabbitMQ is written in) likes to scribble to files in $HOME/.erlang
  C) Need to expose a route so that the Lustre OSS's (running the oddmon collectors) can communicate
    1) THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE YET!  THE DEPLOYMENTCONFIG YAML FILE NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED!
  D) Dockerfile, buildconfig & deployment config yaml files are in the directory with this file
    1) use 'oc create -f rabbitmq-buildconfig.yaml' and 'oc create -f rabbitmq-deploymentconfig.yaml'
    2) Deployment starts out paused and will have to be manually resumed
