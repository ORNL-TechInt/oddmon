Instructions for running the OddMon collector inside the Granite OpenShift cluster


Setup
=====

1) Need a Splunk forwarder pod
  A) Check out the docs at https://doc.granite.ccs.ornl.gov/integration-nccs/splunkExport/
  B) Need two persistent volume claims: one for the log files and one for the forwarder to store state information
  C) Use the splunkforwarder*.yaml files
  D) The configmap.yaml file has dummy passwords in it.  
    1) Actual passwords can be retrieved from the pkpass util (if your username is xmr).
    2) We don't want the passwords in the git repo, so don't add the passwords to the yaml file
    3) Upload the yaml file as-is and then edit it from the OpenShift GUI.
2) RabbitMQ server pod
  A) Doesn't seem to be a pre-packaged version available, so use a docker build
    1) just need the CentOS-7 base and then 'yum install rabbitmq-server'
  B) Need (or at least should probably have) a persistent volume for a backing store for queued messages
  C) *Might* need a config map for the rabbitmq conf file(s), but as long as we mount the persistent volume in the correct location, we can probaby get away with the defaults
  D) Need to expose a route so that the Lustre OSS's (running the oddmon collectors) can communicate
